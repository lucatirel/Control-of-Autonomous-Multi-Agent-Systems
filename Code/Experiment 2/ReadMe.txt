- If you want to see the results ONLY on matlab ---> open 'experiments2_CAMS'. Run the first section to add the symbolic 
	variables to the workspace. Now, according to what you want to see as result, there are 3 possible problem statements that you can solve:
   	1) '3 Double integrators in an environment with obstacles avoided by CBF' ---> change path by opening 'obsavoid' folder. After this folder is opened in your
	'Current Folder' path, you can run all the sections of this problem statement until the section 
	'Leader-follower: 3 Double integrators following a leader with CBF' (excluded)
	2)'Leader-follower: 3 Double integrators following a leader with CBF' ---> change path by opening 'leaderfoll' folder. After this folder is opened in your
	'Current Folder' path, you can run all the sections of this problem statement until the section 
	'Leader-follower: 3 Double integrators following a leader in an environment with obstacles using CBF' (excluded)
	3) 'Leader-follower: 3 Double integrators following a leader in an environment with obstacles using CBF' ---> change path by opening 'leaderfoll_obs' folder. 
	After this folder is opened in your 'Current Folder' path, you can run all the sections of this problem statement until the end



- If you want to see the results ONLY on simulink---> open the folder associated with the problem you want to solve (folder 'obsavoid' , for obstacle avoidance problem,
'leaderfoll' for leader follower without obstacles and 'leaderfoll_obs' for leader follower with obstacles). Then, open the relative file .slx in the folder. Finally, run 
the simulink simulation
